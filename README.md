# Hi, I'm Casey ðŸ‘‹

Software developer based in Seattle, WA, working at Amazon and passionate about open source. I'm currently working on projects related to the Model Context Protocol (MCP), trying to build tools that help build LLM agents.

## ðŸš€ What I'm Building with MCP

I'm currently focused on Model Context Protocol (MCP) projects:

- [**atlas-mcp-server**](https://github.com/cyanheads/atlas-mcp-server) - A TypeScript MCP server using Neo4j for intelligent project management with LLM agents
- [**obsidian-mcp-server**](https://github.com/cyanheads/obsidian-mcp-server) - Connecting LLMs with Obsidian vaults through a secure, token-aware interface
- [**mentor-mcp-server**](https://github.com/cyanheads/mentor-mcp-server) - AI-powered mentorship capabilities with Deepseek-Reasoning R1
- [**toolkit-mcp-server**](https://github.com/cyanheads/toolkit-mcp-server) - System utilities for LLM agents including geolocation, network diagnostics, and cryptographic operations
- [**model-context-protocol-resources**](https://github.com/cyanheads/model-context-protocol-resources) - Practical guides, clients, and servers for exploring the Model Context Protocol

## ðŸ’¡ Side Projects

- [**repo-map**](https://github.com/cyanheads/repo-map) - Generates LLM-enhanced summaries of software repositories
- [**claude-sidebar-modifier**](https://github.com/cyanheads/claude-sidebar-modifier) - Browser extension to customize Claude.ai's interface
- [**scripts-ts**](https://github.com/cyanheads/scripts-ts) - Cross-platform TypeScript utilities for automating common development tasks

## ðŸ§  About Me

I'm a hopeful developer sharing what I learn through open source. I'm just starting out but eager to grow. My interests lie in ML/AI tools, knowledge management, and software development. I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and help others do the same.
