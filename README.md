# Hi, I'm Casey ðŸ‘‹

Software developer based in Seattle, working at Amazon, and passionate about sharing knowledge through open source.

I'm currently working on projects related to the Model Context Protocol (MCP), trying to build a better way for LLMs to interact with the world. I believe AI is an incredibly powerful tool and I'm hoping to make it more accessible and useful for everyone.
