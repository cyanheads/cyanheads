# Hi, I'm Casey ðŸ‘‹

Software Engineer based in Seattle. Passionate about sharing knowledge through open source.

I'm currently working on projects related to the Model Context Protocol (MCP), trying to build a better way for LLMs to interact with the world. I believe AI is an incredibly powerful tool and I'm hoping to make it more accessible and useful for everyone.

## ðŸš€ What I'm Building with MCP

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [model-context-protocol-resources](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/model-context-protocol-resources) | This project contains practical guides, clients, and servers developed during the exploration of the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It serves as a learning resource and a collection of tools. |
| [atlas-mcp-server](https://github.com/cyanheads/atlas-mcp-server) | ATLAS (Adaptive Task & Logic Automation System) is a Neo4j-powered task management system for LLM Agents, using a three-tier architecture to manage complex workflows. It includes Deep Research scaffolding. |
| [filesystem-mcp-server](https://github.com/cyanheads/filesystem-mcp-server) | This server offers platform-agnostic file system capabilities for AI agents via MCP, enabling file and directory management. It features advanced search/replace and directory traversal. |
| [obsidian-mcp-server](https://github.com/cyanheads/obsidian-mcp-server) | This server enables LLMs to securely interact with Obsidian vaults via MCP, offering token-aware tools for managing notes. It facilitates seamless knowledge base management with Properties management. |
| [mentor-mcp-server](https://github.com/cyanheads/mentor-mcp-server) | This server offers AI-powered mentorship via MCP using the Deepseek API, providing LLM agents with a 'second opinion'. It can be used for code review, design critique, writing feedback, and brainstorming. |
| [toolkit-mcp-server](https://github.com/cyanheads/toolkit-mcp-server) | This server provides essential system utilities and tools for LLM agents via MCP. Its features include IP geolocation, network diagnostics, system monitoring, cryptographic operations, and QR code generation. |
| [github-mcp-server](https://github.com/cyanheads/github-mcp-server) | Built in TypeScript, this server integrates with the GitHub API via MCP. It provides a structured interface for LLM agents to manage repositories, issues, pull requests, code, files, and releases. |
| [git-mcp-server](https://github.com/cyanheads/git-mcp-server) | This server provides an enterprise-ready MCP interface for Git operations. It allows LLM agents to initialize, clone, branch, commit, and manage repositories via STDIO & Streamable HTTP. |
| [ntfy-mcp-server](https://github.com/cyanheads/ntfy-mcp-server) | This server integrates with the ntfy.sh push notification service via MCP. It enables LLM agents to send highly customizable notifications to external devices. |
| [perplexity-mcp-server](https://github.com/cyanheads/perplexity-mcp-server) | This server unlocks Perplexity's search-augmented AI capabilities for LLM agents via MCP. It provides access to real-time web information with robust error handling and secure validation. |
| [pubmed-mcp-server](https://github.com/cyanheads/pubmed-mcp-server) | This server connects AI agents to NCBI's PubMed and E-utilities via MCP. It enables search, retrieval, and analysis of biomedical literature. |
| [mcp-reporter](https://github.com/cyanheads/mcp-reporter) | This utility generates comprehensive capability reports for MCP servers. It helps developers understand available functionality across their MCP ecosystem for documentation and integration. |
| [mcp-ts-template](https://github.com/cyanheads/mcp-ts-template) | This is a beginner-friendly, production-ready TypeScript template for building MCP servers and clients. It includes essential utilities, examples, and type safety for a solid starting point. |


## ðŸ’¡ Other Projects

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [repo-map](https://github.com/cyanheads/repo-map) | This project generates LLM-enhanced summaries and analysis of software repositories. It provides developers insights into project structures, file purposes, and considerations across various languages. |
| [claude-sidebar-modifier](https://github.com/cyanheads/claude-sidebar-modifier) | This is a Firefox browser extension allowing users to disable or adjust the width of the sidebar on Claude.ai. It offers a customized interface. |
| [scripts-ts](https://github.com/cyanheads/scripts-ts) | This project is a collection of cross-platform, standalone TypeScript utility scripts. These scripts automate common development tasks like cleaning artifacts, generating structures, and managing dependencies. |

## ðŸ’¼ Open to Opportunities

I'm open to software engineering roles in AI/LLM development and infrastructure, with experience in building LLM agents, MCP servers and general AI tools. I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and help others do the same.
