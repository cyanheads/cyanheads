# Hi, I'm Casey ðŸ‘‹

Software developer based in Seattle, working at Amazon, and passionate about sharing knowledge through open source.

I'm currently working on projects related to the Model Context Protocol (MCP), trying to build tools that help build LLM agents. To build an effective AI agent, focus on setting the LLM up for success by providing the right tools and resources.

## ðŸš€ What I'm Building with MCP

Currently, I am focused on Model Context Protocol (MCP) projects:

- [**atlas-mcp-server**](https://github.com/cyanheads/atlas-mcp-server) - Graph-powered project management system enabling LLM agents to track dependencies, collaborate via whiteboards, and leverage modular skills
- [**obsidian-mcp-server**](https://github.com/cyanheads/obsidian-mcp-server) - Knowledge base connector empowering LLMs to search, navigate, and update Obsidian vaults with semantic understanding
- [**mentor-mcp-server**](https://github.com/cyanheads/mentor-mcp-server) - Personalized AI mentorship framework built on Deepseek-Reasoning R1 for adaptive learning experiences
- [**toolkit-mcp-server**](https://github.com/cyanheads/toolkit-mcp-server) - Essential system utilities giving LLM agents access to geolocation, network diagnostics, and cryptographic operations
- [**github-mcp-server**](https://github.com/cyanheads/github-mcp-server) - Complete GitHub API interface enabling LLMs to manage repositories, branches, issues, PRs, files, and releases
- [**git-mcp-server**](https://github.com/cyanheads/git-mcp-server) - Git operations interface allowing LLM agents to initialize, clone, branch, commit, and manage repositories without direct filesystem access
- [**ntfy-mcp-server**](https://github.com/cyanheads/ntfy-mcp-server) - Push notification service integration allowing LLM agents to send customized alerts to mobile and desktop devices using ntfy.sh
- [**mcp-reporter**](https://github.com/cyanheads/mcp-reporter) - Utility for generating comprehensive reports about MCP server capabilities, helping developers understand available functionality across their MCP ecosystem
- [**mcp-ts-template**](https://github.com/cyanheads/mcp-ts-template) - Production-ready TypeScript template for building MCP servers with rock-solid architecture, utilities, and working examples - perfect for vibe code sessions!
- [**model-context-protocol-resources**](https://github.com/cyanheads/model-context-protocol-resources) - Practical guides, clients, and servers I'm building while exploring the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and what it can do!

## ðŸ’¡ Side Projects

- [**repo-map**](https://github.com/cyanheads/repo-map) - Generates LLM-enhanced summaries of software repositories
- [**claude-sidebar-modifier**](https://github.com/cyanheads/claude-sidebar-modifier) - Firefox browser extension to customize Claude.ai's interface
- [**scripts-ts**](https://github.com/cyanheads/scripts-ts) - Cross-platform TypeScript utilities for automating common development tasks

## ðŸ§  About Me

I'm a hopeful developer sharing what I learn through open source. I'm just starting out but eager to grow. My interests lie in ML/AI tools, knowledge management, and software development. I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and help others do the same.

## ðŸ’¼ Open to Opportunities

I'm open to software engineering roles in AI/LLM development and infrastructure, with experience in building LLM agents, MCP servers and general AI tools.
