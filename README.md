# Hi, I'm Casey ðŸ‘‹
Software developer based in Seattle, working at Amazon, and passionate about open source. I'm currently working on projects related to the Model Context Protocol (MCP), trying to build tools that help build LLM agents.

My philosophy on building effective AI agents centers on creating environments where they can thrive naturally. Rather than implementing rigid constraints, I believe in setting up the right foundations and letting the intelligence of the models shine through. The best agent systems provide clear pathways for models to leverage their capabilities while offering gentle guidance instead of strict control.

## ðŸš€ What I'm Building with MCP
I'm currently focused on Model Context Protocol (MCP) projects:
- [**atlas-mcp-server**](https://github.com/cyanheads/atlas-mcp-server) - Graph-powered project management system enabling LLM agents to track dependencies, collaborate via whiteboards, and leverage modular skills
- [**obsidian-mcp-server**](https://github.com/cyanheads/obsidian-mcp-server) - Knowledge base connector empowering LLMs to search, navigate, and update Obsidian vaults with semantic understanding
- [**mentor-mcp-server**](https://github.com/cyanheads/mentor-mcp-server) - Personalized AI mentorship framework built on Deepseek-Reasoning R1 for adaptive learning experiences
- [**toolkit-mcp-server**](https://github.com/cyanheads/toolkit-mcp-server) - Essential system utilities giving LLM agents access to geolocation, network diagnostics, and cryptographic operations
- [**model-context-protocol-resources**](https://github.com/cyanheads/model-context-protocol-resources) - Practical guides, clients, and servers for exploring the Model Context Protocol

## ðŸ’¡ Side Projects
- [**repo-map**](https://github.com/cyanheads/repo-map) - Generates LLM-enhanced summaries of software repositories
- [**claude-sidebar-modifier**](https://github.com/cyanheads/claude-sidebar-modifier) - Browser extension to customize Claude.ai's interface
- [**scripts-ts**](https://github.com/cyanheads/scripts-ts) - Cross-platform TypeScript utilities for automating common development tasks

## ðŸ§  About Me
I'm a hopeful developer sharing what I learn through open source. I'm just starting out but eager to grow. My interests lie in ML/AI tools, knowledge management, and software development. I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and help others do the same.

## ðŸ’¼ Open to Opportunities
I'm currently open to software engineering roles, particularly in AI/LLM agent development and infrastructure. With experience building MCP servers and tools for LLM integration, I'm passionate about creating the next generation of intelligent systems. If you're working on transformative AI tools or agent frameworks, I'd love to connect!
