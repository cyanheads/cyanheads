# Hi, I'm Casey ðŸ‘‹

Software Engineer based in Seattle. Passionate about sharing knowledge through open source.

I'm currently working on projects related to the Model Context Protocol (MCP), trying to build a better way for LLMs to interact with the world. I believe AI is an incredibly powerful tool and I'm hoping to make it more accessible and useful for everyone.
